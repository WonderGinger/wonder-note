- hit the bottom of the spring (important)
- upright demo as early as possible without dying
- continue to fast fall (i use decicated fastfall button even on kb)

---

- right dash using the top of this green tile in the bg of cue 1
- start fast falling somewhere around here, find your own exact cue (can be between the bottom spinners, or slightly lower)
