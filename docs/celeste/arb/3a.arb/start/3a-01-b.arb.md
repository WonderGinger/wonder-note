- entry: once you are touching the towels do a hyper with buffered jump, then buffer the climb jump and the spike jump

the cue I use that seems to be consistent regardless of other animations is the black pixels beneath her chin; they look like a T shape on the frames leading up to the good one, and an L (bottom black pixel gone) on the good frame

1st frame after buffered spike jump

good frame (go)

#### alternate 1
![[3a-01-b.1.alt3.arb.mp4]]
- same entry
- 1f demo on this frame
- can do this if missed frame window for lower demo

##### alternate 1.5 (pause buffered, loses 0.5-1.0)
![[3a-01-b.1.alt1.arb.mp4]]

##### alternate 2
![[3a-01-b.1.alt2.arb.mp4]]

- upleft demo through transition to get enough height
- use short climb jumps to not gain too much height on the falling blocks
