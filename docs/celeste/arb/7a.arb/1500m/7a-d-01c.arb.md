- only 1 valid frame for downdash
- the wallbounce needs to be somewhat delayed after the updash (can't be too late)

#### alternate
![[7a-d-01c.1.alt1.arb.mp4]]

* left dash until bonk, fall until
* cue: 2 left dashes when you are lined up with the top of the bookshelf
* stay neutral while falling to the platform, do a instant max height hyper to the wall
* ideally redirect a left dash to down-left
