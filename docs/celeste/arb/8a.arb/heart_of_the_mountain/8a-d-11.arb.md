![[8a-d-11.arb.mp4]]
- hold upright to slowly climb up after the feather, buffer max instant hyper after landing
- continue to hold jump, down, and right through transition to set up position on core block
- hyper is a 4f window: first 2f are worse because you dont land cleanly (still faster than normal strat)
- use the chains in the bg as a cue; start the hyper after passing the first chain

#### alternate
![[8a-d-11.alt1.arb.mp4]]
* entry: pre-transition full hyper, but release jump during transition, hold right and down until at the edge of the core block
* make sure to jump off the block very late to get enough distance for the demohyper
