- latest possible jump to the falling ice block is the setup for 2 min climb jumps to get on the top
> ruyunata: need half gravity after the climb at the very top so keep holding that jump as you slide to the right and buffer with a 2nd jump button. saves over a second
- ending: neutral wallkick and walk to the edge, demo at the edge and jump at around the middle of the block above (use the center crystal as a cue)

* if the cj and first 2 jumps on the big ice platform are small, a full 3rd jump lines up the corner kick to make it easier
* start the up-right demo pretty early, or else you won't uncrouch in time
